# Performance

The topic of performance often comes up when React is taught and used. Out-of-the-box React is actually pretty fast. Most of the time you shouldn't need to really think about speed until you find that it's getting slow. At that point, you can assess the performance with the React DevTools and identify places to tweak.

If you have determined a section of your App that is rendering too much, you can usually use one or more of the following APIs to help address the issue.

- `React.memo` (much like the class shouldComponentUpdate counterpart)
- `useCallback`
- `useMemo`

## Lab

### `TicTacToe.js`

NOTE: The following exercise is overkill and I'm not concerned about the performance of the TicTacToe component, but I do want to show the technqiues that can could help improve performance.

If we add a `console.log` in the Square component, you'll notice in the console that all 9 squares are re-renedered even though 8 of them havne't changed.

```jsx
function Square({ value, index, onClick }) {
  console.log("Square", { index, value });
  /* ... */
}
```

### `TicTacToe.js`

Our first attempt to reduce the re-rendering of the Square component is going to be using the `React.memo` Higher Order Compnent (HOC).

```jsx
import React, { memo, useReducer } from "react";

/* ... */

const Square = memo(({ value, index, onClick }) => {
  console.log("Square", { index, value });
  /* ... */
});
```

Well, that didn't work did it? Why is that? It turns out that we are passing a new onClick function reference each time so `memo` thinks it should actually render it.

### `TicTacToe.js`

#### Fix #1

`React.memo` has a 2nd argument that allows you to pass a `areEqual` function to give React a bit more information about when it should rerender.

```jsx
import React, { memo, useCallback, useReducer } from "react";
import classNames from "classnames";
import "./TicTacToe.scss";

/* Option 1 - memo with areEqual 2nd argument */
const Square = memo(
  ({ value, index, onClick }) => {
    console.log("Square", { index, value });
    return (
      <button className="Square" onClick={() => onClick(index)}>
        {value}
      </button>
    );
  },
  (prev, next) => prev.value === next.value
);

/* ... */

export default function Game() {
  /* ... */

  /* Option 1 - memo with areEqual 2nd argument */
  const handleClick = index => dispatch({ type: "MOVE", index });
  const handleStart = () => dispatch({ type: "START" });

  /* ... */
}
```

### `TicTacToe.js`

#### Fix #2

Another way to fix this is to continue and use the 1 argument of `memo`, but we need to address the fact that onClick keeps getting difference referneces. To do this, we can use the `useCallback` hook.

```jsx
import React, { memo, useCallback, useReducer } from "react";
import classNames from "classnames";
import "./TicTacToe.scss";

/* Option 2 - memo with useCallback */
const Square = memo(({ value, index, onClick }) => {
  console.log("Square", { index, value });
  return (
    <button className="Square" onClick={() => onClick(index)}>
      {value}
    </button>
  );
});

export default function Game() {
  /* ... */

  /* Option 2 - memo with useCallback */
  const handleClick = useCallback(index => dispatch({ type: "MOVE", index }), [
    dispatch
  ]);
  const handleStart = useCallback(() => dispatch({ type: "START" }), [
    dispatch
  ]);

  /* ... */
}
```
