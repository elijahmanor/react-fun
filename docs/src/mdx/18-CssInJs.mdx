# CSS in JS

The idea of including styling inside of JavaScript is somewhat controversal. It can be quite shocking if you aren't used to it, but there are some benefits.

## Library Choices

There are numerous different techniques and libraries that you can use. Some common libraries these days are [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

[Max Stoiber](https://mobile.twitter.com/mxstbr), creator of [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), has a recent article explaining [Why I Write CSS in JavaScript](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js/). Another good article explaining the concept is [Oleg Isonen's](https://mobile.twitter.com/oleg008) article [What actually is CSS-in-JS?](https://medium.com/dailyjs/what-is-actually-css-in-js-f2f529a2757)

## Lab

Let's change out the button styles in the `TicTacToe` component to use the [`emotion`](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) library to style.

### New `Button.js`

For the following Component we will need to install the following dependencies...

```shell
npm i @emotion/core @emotion/styled
# OR
npm i @emotion/{core,styled}
# OR
yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/styled
```

```js
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const Button = styled.button`
  display: inline-block;
  border: none;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
  margin: 0 0.5rem 0 0;
  min-width: 5rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  background: \${props => (props.primary ? "#0069ed" : "#ccc")};
  color: \${props => (props.primary ? "#fff" : "#000")};
  font-size: 1rem;
  cursor: pointer;
  text-align: center;
  transition: background 250ms ease-in-out, transform 150ms ease;

  &:last-of-type {
    margin-right: 0;
  }

  &:hover,
  &:focus {
    background: ${props => (props.primary ? "#0053ba" : "#aaa")};
  }

  &:focus {
    outline: 1px solid #fff;
    outline-offset: -4px;
  }

  &:active {
    transform: scale(0.99);
  }
`;

export default Button;
```

### Update `TicTacToe.js`

```jsx
/* ... */
import Button from "./Button";
/* ... */

function Announcement({ winner, onStart }) {
  /* ... */
  return (
    <animated.div style={props} className="Announcement">
      {/* ... */}
      <Button primary onClick={onStart}>
        Start
      </Button>
    </animated.div>
  );
}
```
