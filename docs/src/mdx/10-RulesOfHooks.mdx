# Rules of Hooks

1. Only call Hooks at the Top Level

   With this in mind, no conditional hooks, hooks in loops, or hooks in different orders. Remember how we made our own implementation of useState? Order is very important.

2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions

   You can call hooks from a Function React Component or from a custom React hook (which we will talk more about later)

## ESLint Rules

Thankfully the React team has put together an ESLint rule to help enforce these rules in addition to other helpful suggestions when using hooks.

```shell
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev

# OR

yarn add eslint-plugin-react-hooks --dev
```

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error", // Checks rules of Hooks
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" // Checks effect dependencies
  }
}
```

## `create-react-app`

If you are using `create-react-app` then these rules are already installed and enabled.
