## So, it's like Angular or Ember?

Nope

> Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. --[React Website](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## So, it's a template library?

Nope

> React components are far more powerful than Angular templates; they should be compared with Angular's directives instead --[Pete Hunt (Quora)](http://www.quora.com/Pete-Hunt/Posts/Facebooks-React-vs-AngularJS-A-Closer-Look))

## Why is it Compelling?

- Declarative and Composable
- Virtual DOM
- One-Way Data Flow

## Declarative and Composable

- React is an Abstraction away from the DOM
- Re-render the whole app on every update (not really)
- It Simplifies the Mental Model
- Mix and match components to build UIs

### Imperative: How

```js
$("form").on("submit", function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  $.ajax({
    url: "/customers",
    type: "POST",
    data: $(this).serialize(),
    success: function(data) {
      $(".status").append("<h3>" + data + "</h3>");
    }
  });
});
```

### Declarative: What

```jsx
class NoteBox extends Component {
  // ... more code ...
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="NoteBox">
        <h1>Notes</h1>
        <NoteList data={this.state.data} />
        <NoteForm onPost={this.handlePost} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Virtual DOM

- Re-rendering the whole app on every update is not efficient
- The Virtual DOM will only update what is necessary
- It works much like a Gaming Engine

## React Uses a One-Way Data Flow

> ...you can set the directionality of it to be 2-Way Data Binding. That actually seems to be a good idea until you have a large scale application and then it turns out you have no idea whats going on... and turns out to be an anti-pattern for large apps. --[Misko Hevery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD6Okha_Yj0#t=1785)

## So, Why is it Compelling?

> Declarative → Predictable → Confidence → Reliability --[Tom Ochino's React.js Conf keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4#t=868)
