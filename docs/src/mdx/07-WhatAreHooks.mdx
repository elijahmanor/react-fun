# What are Hooks?

React Hooks were introduced in version 16.8 and they provide a way to let you use state and other React features in a function component without using a class.

## Warnings

Hooks are 100% backward compatible and you don't have to use them if you don't want to.

Also, don't worry there are no plans to remove Class Components from React.

## Why Hooks?

The concept of `this` in Class Components could get confusing
Complex Class Components could get hard to understand
Sharing state logic across Class Components could be difficult

## Adoption

It is highly encouraged not to REWRITE ALL THE THINGS! Instead, it is recommended to gradually start integrating hooks as you create new Components in your application.
